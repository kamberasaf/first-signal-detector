# First Signal Detector - Design Specification

## Overview
This document provides detailed design specifications for the first signal detector module.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Signal Detection
- The system shall monitor three input signals (A, B, C)
- The system shall detect the first signal(s) to become active
- The system shall support simultaneous signal detection

### FR-2: Output Encoding
- The system shall output a 3-bit value encoding detected signals
- Bit 0 represents signal A detection
- Bit 1 represents signal B detection  
- Bit 2 represents signal C detection

### FR-3: Lock Mechanism
- Once any signal is detected, the output shall be permanently locked
- Subsequent signal changes shall not affect the output
- Only a reset can unlock the system

### FR-4: Reset Behavior
- Active-low reset shall clear all internal state
- Reset shall set output to 000
- Reset shall prepare system for new detection cycle

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
- Single always_ff block for synchronous logic
- Sticky enable mechanism using OR gate with feedback
- Conditional assignment based on enable state

### Timing
- All outputs synchronized to positive clock edge
- Reset is asynchronous (negedge rst)
- Single clock cycle detection latency

### Resource Utilization
- 4 flip-flops (3 for output, 1 for sticky enable)
- Minimal combinational logic (OR gates, multiplexers)
- No external memory or complex state machines required

## Verification Strategy

### Test Cases
1. Reset verification
2. Single signal detection (A, B, C individually)
3. Simultaneous signal combinations (AB, AC, BC, ABC)
4. Lock behavior verification
5. Signal removal testing

### Coverage Metrics
- Functional coverage: 100% of input combinations
- Code coverage: 100% of RTL statements
- Assertion coverage: Reset, lock, and detection assertions

## Synthesis Considerations

### Target Technologies
- Compatible with any FPGA or ASIC technology
- No technology-specific primitives required
- Synthesizable with standard synthesis tools

### Performance
- Maximum frequency limited only by setup/hold requirements
- No critical timing paths
- Suitable for high-speed applications

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Extensions
- Configurable number of input signals
- Priority encoding option
- Timeout mechanism for detection window
- Multiple detection cycles with programmable reset
